stanbol.enhancer.engine.name.description=The name of the enhancement engine as \
used in the RESTful interface '/engine/<name>'

service.ranking.name=Ranking
service.ranking.description=If two enhancement engines with the same name are active the \
one with the higher ranking will be used to process parsed content items.

stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.name = Apache Stanbol Enhancer Engine: Named Entity Extraction
stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.description = Find names of people, organization, \
 places... using previously trained OpenNLP models.
stanbol.opennlp.models.path.name = Path to folder holding OpenNLP models
stanbol.opennlp.models.path.description = All OpenNLP files need to be in the same folder using \
 the same naming convention as the OpenNLP project in version 1.5 and following.
stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.defaultLanguage.name = Default Language
stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.defaultLanguage.description = Allows to configure \
a language that is used as default if the language of the parsed content is not known. If \
empty no default language is used.
stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.processedLanguages.name = Languages
stanbol.NamedEntityExtractionEnhancementEngine.processedLanguages.description = Languages to process. \
An empty text indicates that all languages are processed. Use ',' as separator for languages \
(e.g. 'en,de' to enhance only English and German texts). \
NOTE: This porperty can be used to configure multiple instances of this engine that \
process only documents with specific languages. This might e.g. be useful to \
enable/disable NER for specific languages.

stanbol.CustomNERModelEnhancementEngine.name=Apache Stanbol Enhancer Engine: Custom NER Model
stanbol.CustomNERModelEnhancementEngine.description=NER Engine that allows to configure custom \
OpenNLP NameFinder modles for arbitrary Named Entity types
stanbol.engines.opennlp-ner.typeMappings.name=Type Mappings
stanbol.engines.opennlp-ner.typeMappings.description="{named-entity-type} > {uri}" mappings \
for the Named Entity Types recognized by any of the configured NER models to the URIs used \
as values for the dc:type property for the generated fise:TextAnnotations. NOTE: that \
TextAnnotations for unmapped Named Entity Types will have no dc:type information.
stanbol.engines.opennlp-ner.nameFinderModels.name=Name Finder Models
stanbol.engines.opennlp-ner.nameFinderModels.description=The list of NER - OpenNLP \
