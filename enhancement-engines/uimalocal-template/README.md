# Apache Stanbol UIMA Local Client

This is a template Enhancement Engine to integrate Stanbol with your own UIMA engines.
For instructions, see: http://blog.iks-project.eu/running-uima-engines-in-stanbol-using-the-same-jvm/
But in general instead using this local client solution, the UIMA Remote Client is recommended,
which is much easier and does not require custom bundling. See:
