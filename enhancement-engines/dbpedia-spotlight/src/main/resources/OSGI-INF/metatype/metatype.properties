dbpedia.spotlight.url.name = Spotlight URL
dbpedia.spotlight.url.description = The URL which will be used for the request
dbpedia.spotlight.spotter.name = Spotter
dbpedia.spotlight.spotter.description = The algorithm which will be used for Spotting \
    (aka Term Recognition). Currently available: NER, LingPipeSpotter, OpenNLPChunkerSpotter, Kea
dbpedia.spotlight.disambiguator.name = Disambiguator
dbpedia.spotlight.disambiguator.description = The algorithm used for ranking of senses \
     based on context. Currently available: Document, Occurrences
dbpedia.spotlight.types.name = Types Restriction
dbpedia.spotlight.types.description = The DBpedia Ontology types you wish to restrict your results to
dbpedia.spotlight.sparql.name = Sparql
dbpedia.spotlight.sparql.description = Restrict the result with SPARQL
dbpedia.spotlight.support.name = Support
dbpedia.spotlight.support.description = Filter the results based on a support metric
dbpedia.spotlight.confidence.name = Confidence
dbpedia.spotlight.confidence.description = Filter the results based on a confidence metric


#Annotate

dbpedia.spotlight.name = DBpedia Spotlight Annotate: Named Entity Extraction and Ontology Linking
dbpedia.spotlight.description = Find names of people, organization, \
 places... disambiguate and link them to DBpedia Ontology URIs. This is a complete EnhancementChain, all in one Engine.


# SPOT

stanbol.DBPSpotlightSpotEnhancementEngine.name = DBpedia Spotlight Spotter: Named Entity Recognition
stanbol.DBPSpotlightSpotEnhancementEngine.description = This engine performs just Named Entity Recognition, \
    so it is suited for EnhancementChain scenario, in which another Engine links the recognized TextAnnotations \
    to Ontology Types

# Candidates

stanbol.DBPSpotlightCandidatesEnhancementEngine.name = DBpedia Spotlight Candidates: Named Entity Extraction and Ontology Linking
stanbol.DBPSpotlightCandidatesEnhancementEngine.description = Find names of people, organization, \
 places... disambiguate and link them to DBpedia Ontology URIs. The difference to the DBPSpotlightAnnotateEnhancementEngine is that  \
 all candidate URIs for a given TextAnnotation are delivered, as opposed to just the top K 


#Disambiguate

stanbol.DBPSpotlightDisambiguateEnhancementEngine.name = DBpedia Spotlight Disambiguate: Disambiguation and Ontology Linking
stanbol.DBPSpotlightDisambiguateEnhancementEngine.description = It uses TextAnnotations added by a Spotter, so it can only be used \
 in an EnhancementChain context. It disambiguates and links them to DBpedia Ontology URIs.
