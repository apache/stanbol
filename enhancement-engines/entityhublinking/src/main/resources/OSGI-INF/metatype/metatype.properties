stanbol.enhancer.engine.name.name=Name
stanbol.enhancer.engine.name.description=The name of the enhancement engine as \
used in the RESTful interface '/engine/<name>'

service.ranking.name=Ranking
service.ranking.description=If two enhancement engines with the same name are active the \
one with the higher ranking will be used to process parsed content items.


#===============================================================================
#Properties and Options used to configure 
#===============================================================================
org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.engines.entityhublinking.EntityhubLinkingEngine.name=Apache \
Stanbol Enhancer Engine: Entityhub Linking
org.apache.stanbol.enhancer.engines.entityhublinking.EntityhubLinkingEngine.description=An engine \
that links NLP processed text with Entities of the Entityhub Sites.

enhancer.engines.linking.entityhub.siteId.name=Referenced Site
enhancer.engines.linking.entityhub.siteId.description=The ID of the \
Entityhub Referenced Site holding the Controlled Vocabulary (e.g. a taxonomy or just a set of \
named entities). To match against the whole Entityhub use "entityhub" as value.

enhancer.engines.linking.minSearchTokenLength.name=Min Token Length
enhancer.engines.linking.minSearchTokenLength.description=The minimum \
length of Tokens used to lookup Entities within the Controlled Vocabulary. This parameter is ignored \
in case a POS (Part of Speech) tagger is available for the language of the parsed content.

enhancer.engines.linking.labelField.name=Label Field 
enhancer.engines.linking.labelField.description=The field used to match \
Entities with a mentions within the parsed text.

enhancer.engines.linking.typeField.name=Type Field
enhancer.engines.linking.typeField.description=The field used to \
retrieve the types of matched Entities. Values of that field are expected to be URIs

enhancer.engines.linking.caseSensitive.name=Case Sensitivity
enhancer.engines.linking.caseSensitive.description=Allows to enable/disable \
case sensitive matching

enhancer.engines.linking.redirectField.name=Redirect Field
enhancer.engines.linking.redirectField.description=Entities may \
define redirects to other Entities (e.g. "USA"(http://dbpedia.org/resource/USA) -> \
"United States"(http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States). Values of this field are \
expected to link to other entities part of the controlled vocabulary

enhancer.engines.linking.suggestions.name=Suggestions
enhancer.engines.linking.suggestions.description=The maximal \
number of suggestions returned for a single mention. 

enhancer.engines.linking.includeSimilarScore.name=Include Similar Score Suggestions
enhancer.engines.linking.includeSimilarScore.description= If enabled all suggestions \
with a similar score as the last one will be included in the result. Enabling this \
will result in more entities being suggested as configured by 'Max Suggestions'

enhancer.engines.linking.minFoundTokens.name=Number of Required Tokens
enhancer.engines.linking.minFoundTokens.description=For lookups with \
several words (e.g. Dr Patrick Marshall) this is the minimum number of Tokens the label of an \
entity must match to be suggested. This is only used of the label does not exactly match a part \
of the text.

enhancer.engines.linking.redirectMode.name=Redirect Mode
enhancer.engines.linking.redirectMode.description=Defines how to \
process redirects of Entities mentioned in the parsed content.. Three modes to deal with such \
links are supported: Ignore redirects; Add values from redirected Entities to extracted; Follow \
Redirects and suggest the redirected Entity instead of the extracted.
enhancer.engines.linking.redirectMode.option.follow=Follow Redirects
enhancer.engines.linking.redirectMode.option.addValues=Keep extracted \
Entity, but add information of the redirected
enhancer.engines.linking.redirectMode.option.ignore=Ignore Redirects

enhancer.engines.linking.properNounsState.name=Link ProperNouns only
enhancer.engines.linking.properNounsState.description=If activated \
only ProperNouns will be matched against the Vocabulary. If deactivated any Noun will be matched. \
NOTE that this parameter requires a tag of the POS TagSet to be mapped against 'olia:PorperNoun'. \
Otherwise mapping will not work as expected.

enhancer.engines.linking.processedLanguages.name=Processed Languages
enhancer.engines.linking.processedLanguages.description=Languages to \
process and optionally language specific configurations. Syntax "{lang};{param-name}={param-value};\
{param-name}={param-value};...". Supported {param-name}s: "lc" - processed Lexical Categories (see \
LexicalCategory enumeration for possible values); "pos" - processed Pos types (see Pos enumeration \
for possible values); "tag" - processed string pos tags; "prob" - minumum probability of pos annotations.

enhancer.engines.linking.defaultMatchingLanguage.name=Default Matching Language
enhancer.engines.linking.defaultMatchingLanguage.description=The language \
used in addition to the language detected for the analysed text to search for Entities. Typically this \
configuration is an empty string to search for labels without any language defined, but for some data \
sets (such as DBpedia.org) that add languages to any labels it might improve resuls to change this \
configuration (e.g. to 'en' in the case of DBpedia.org).

enhancer.engines.linking.dereference.name=Dereference Entities
enhancer.engines.linking.dereference.description=If enabled additional \
data for suggested Entities are included.

enhancer.engines.linking.dereferenceFields.name=Fields used for dereferencing
enhancer.engines.linking.dereferenceFields.description=If 'Dereference Entities' is enabled \
data from this fields will be included for suggested Entities.

enhancer.engines.linking.typeMappings.name=Type Mappings
enhancer.engines.linking.typeMappings.description=This allows to add \
additional entity-type > text-annotation-type mappings. Such mappings are used to determine the \
'dc:type' value of the 'fise:TextAnnotation' created for extracted entities. Usage: \
variant (a) '{uri}' short for {uri} > {uri} or (b) '{source1};{source2};..;{sourceN} > {target}'. \
Note that a {source} may be only mapped to a single {target}. Multiple {source} types \
can be mapped to the same {target}.

enhancer.engines.linking.keywordTokenizer.name=Keyword Tokenizer
enhancer.engines.linking.keywordTokenizer.description=This allows \
to use a special Tokenizer for matching keywords and alpha numeric IDs. Typical language \
specific Tokenizers tned to split such IDs in several tokens and therefore might prevent \
a correct matching.

enhancer.engines.linking.minTokenScore.name=Minimum Token Score
enhancer.engines.linking.minTokenScore.description=The minimum score a single Token \
of the text must match a Token of the Label so that it is considered to match. [0..1].\
The score is calculated by comparing the matching characters from the beginning of the two \
tokens compared to the overal size of the token. So it allows derivations at the end of the \
of the tokens (e.g because of inflected forms of words).

enhancer.engines.linking.entityTypes.name=Entity Type Filter
enhancer.engines.linking.entityTypes.description=Allows to define a white/black list \
based on the types of Entities. Use '!{uri}' for black listing and '{uri}' for white \
listing. Include '*' to force white listing (e.g. to allow Entities without any type). \
Rules are processed based on their oder.
