     * NLOC Noun Location This is an entirely new tag introduced to cover an important phenomenon of Indian
     * Languages. Words like 'Age', 'upara', 'pahele', 'bAda', etc. are used in various ways in Hindi.
     * <ol>
     * <li>They act as a postposition along with 'ke' e.g. ghade ke upara thAlI rakhI HE. ("pot" "on" "plate"
     * "kept" "is") Here 'ke upara' is a post position which is the direct equivalent of the English
     * preposition 'on'.
     * <li>They also act as adverbs. e.g. tuma upara jAo. ("You" "up" "go") Here 'upara' is an adverbial of
     * place.
     * <li>These words also take post positions themselves and so in some sense behave like nouns. e.g. vaHa
     * upara se AyA. ("He" "above" "from" "came")
     * <li>As pointed out in 3. above, these words take postpositions and act as arguments of the verb in the
     * sentence. And they also take a post position to join with a another noun. So in that sense also they
     * behave like nouns. e.g. upara kA HissA ("above" "of" "portion")
     * </ol>
     * To tag such words one option is to tag them according to the category to which they belong in the given
     * sentence. For example in 1. above, the word is occurring as a postposition so can be marked as a
     * postposition. In example 2. above, it is an adverb so can be marked as an adverb and so on.
     * <p>
     * But we feel that these words are more like nouns as is evident from 3. and 4. above, and also if we
     * consider for examples, 'aage', 'upara', etc. as places which are in front, up, etc then we can tag them
     * as nouns.
     * <p>
     * But these are not pure nouns. They are nouns which indicate a location or time. These also function as
     * adverbs or prepositions in a context. So a new tag NLOC is introduced for such words. This tag will
     * cater to a finite set of such words. set: (Age, piche, upara, nIce, bAda, pahele) ("front", "behind",
     * "above", "below", "before") Such words if tagged according to their syntactic function, it will hamper
     * machine learning. So a single tag, NLOC has been devised for such words which indicate location and
     * time.

     * In linguistics, a light verb is a verb participating in complex predication that has little semantic

     * determined by the head or primary component of the compound, which may be a verb or noun (V+V or V+N
     * compounds). Other names for "light verb" include: vector verb or explicator verb, emphasising its role
     * within the compound; or thin verb or semantically weak verb, emphasising (as with "light") its lack of
     * semantics. A "semantically weak" verb is not to be confused with a "weak verb" as in the Germanic weak
     * inflection. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs in some ways.
     * <p>
     * Most English light verbs occur in V+N forms sometimes called "stretched verbs": for example, take in
     * take a nap, where the primary sense is provided by "nap", and "take" is the light verb. The light verbs
     * most common in these constructions are also common in phrasal verbs. A verb which is "light" in one

     * French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, "pretend"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall,
     * "start to leave"); and the bǎ construction in Chinese.[1] Some verbs are found in many such
     * expressions; to reuse an earlier example, take is found in take a nap, take a shower, take a sip, take
     * a bow, take turns, and so on. Light verbs are extremely common in Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, and
