<@common.page title="Welcome to Apache Stanbol!" hasrestapi=false> 

<p>Apache Stanbol is an Open Source HTTP service meant to help Content
Management System developers to semi-automatically enhance unstructured
content (text, image, ...) with semantic annotations to be able to link
documents with related entities and topics.</p>

<p>Please go to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol">the
official website</a> to learn more on the project, read the
documentation and join the mailing list.</p>

<p>Here are the main HTTP entry points. Each resource comes with a web
view that documents the matching RESTful API for applications:</p>
<dl>

  <#list it.navigationLinks as link>
  <#if link.hasDescriptionTemplate>
    <dt><a href="${it.publicBaseUri}${link.path}">${link.label}</a><dt>
    <dd><#include "${link.descriptionTemplate}"></dd>
  </#if>
  </#list>

  <dt><a href="${it.consoleBaseUri}">/system/console</a><dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This is the OSGi administration console (for administrators and developers). The initial
       username / password is set to <em>admin / admin</em>.</p>
    <p>Use the console to add new bundles and activate, de-activate and configure components.</p>
    <p>The console can also be used to perform hot-(re)deployment of any OSGi bundles.
       For instance to re-deploy a new version of this web interface, go to the <tt>$STANBOL_HOME/enhancer/jersey</tt>
       source folder and run the following command:</p>
<pre>
mvn install -o -DskipTests -PinstallBundle \
    -Dsling.url=${it.consoleBaseUri}
</pre>
  </dd>

</dl>
