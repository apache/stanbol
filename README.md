# Apache Stanbol

Apache Stanbol is a modular set of components and HTTP services for
semantic content management.

## Building Stanbol

To build Stanbol you need a JDK 1.6 and Maven 2.2.1 installed. You probably
need

    $ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256M"

The following builds the Apache Stanbol plus available Enhancement Engines and a
default set of linked open data for the EntityHub. If you want to have a ready
to use version of Apache Stanbol, this is the way to go.

In the Apache Stanbol source directory type

    $ mvn install

If you want to skip the tests, use :

    $ mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    

### Launching the Apache Stanbol Server

The recommended lanchers are packaged under the `launchers/` folder. For
instance:

    $ java -Xmx1g -jar launchers/full/target/org.apache.stanbol.launchers.full-0.10.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar

Your instance is then available on <http://localhost:8080>. You can change the
default port number by passing a `-p 9090` options to the commandline launcher.

Upon first startup, a folder named `sling/` is created in the current folder.
This folder will hold the files for any database used by Stanbol, deployment
configuration and logs.

If Stanbol is launched with a FactStore a folder named `factstore` is created
in the current folder. This folder holds the FactStore database (Apache Derby).
  

## Importing the source code as Eclipse projects

Eclipse is the most popular IDE among Stanbol developers. Here are
instructions to get you started with this IDE. For other IDEs / editors,
please refer to their documentation and maven integration plugins.

To generate the Eclipse project definition files, go to Stanbol source
directory and type:

    $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

If you want to recreate already existing Eclipse projects, you have to delete
the old ones first by using `eclipse:clean`.

Then in Eclipse, right click on the `Project Explorer` panel and select
your source folder from the following menu / import wizard:

    > Import... > General > Import Existing Projects into Workspace

You will also need to setup the build path variable `M2_REPO` pointing to
`~/.m2/repository` (where `~` stands for the path to your home folder). To set
up this variable go to:

    > Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables > New...

If you plan to contribute patches to the project, please ensure that your style
follow the official sun java guidelines with 4 space indents (no tabs). To
ensure that your files follow the guidelines you can import the formatter
definitions avaiable in the `conventions/` folder:

    > Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Import...

You can then apply the formatter to a selected area of a Java source code files
by pressing `Shift+Ctrl+F`.


## Debugging an Apache Stanbol Instance from Eclipse

To debug a locally running Stanbol instance from eclipse, run the stanbol
launcher with::

    $ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n \
           -jar org.apache.stanbol.some.launcher-[VERSION].jar -p 8080

In eclipse, you can then create a new "Debug Configuration" with type "Remote
Java Application" and connect it to localhost on port 8787.

## License check via the Apache's Release Audit Tool (RAT)

To check for license headers within the source code Stanbol uses the RAT Maven
plugin [1]. You can activate a 'rat:check' by using the 'rat' Maven profile.

For example to check the licenses in the Stanbol Framework use

    $ mvn install -Prat

## Release Apache Stanbol

You should read [1,2] before doing any release related actions.

To do a release test build, you have to activate the 'apache-release' profile.
For building Apache Stanbol plus signing the artifacts as it would be done during
a release you can use

    $ mvn install -Papache-release

The 'apache-release' profile will be automatically activated when the Maven
release plugin [3] is used. For doing official release you start with

    $ mvn release:prepare

[2] http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html
[3] http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/
